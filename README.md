# Feelee: Personalized Mental Health Support for Young People

## General Description

### Problem
Young people are increasingly experiencing stress-related complaints, but traditional mental health care often fails to attract this demographic. There is a significant need for accessible and personalized mental health support. Feelee aims to fill this gap by offering adaptive advice and interventions through smart-cueing. To date, over 4,000 young people have downloaded and used the app.

### Goals
- **Pattern Recognition**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical data analysis (SDA) to find patterns among Feelee users.
- **User Profiling**: Develop a machine learning model to create user profiles based on the data.

## Plans and Methodologies

### Data Preparation
1. **Clean the Dataset**: Ensure the dataset is organized and ready for analysis.

### Data Exploration and Analysis
1. **EDA + SDA**: Summarize statistics, create visualizations, and perform correlation tests to understand the dataset better.

### Machine Learning Models
Algorithm: k-means clustering
1. **Inputs**:
   - **User Information**: Demographics such as age and gender.
   - **Emotional States**: Responses to questions about their emotional state.
   - **Physical Activity**: Data on physical activity, such as step counts.
2. **Output**:
   - **User Profiles**: Classify users into one of 15-20 clusters based on the inputs.
3. **Result Analysis**

### Requirements
- **Data Reduction**: Focus on user information and the last 7 days of emotional states and physical activity.
- **Minimum Data**: At least 7 days of information is required.

## Other Methods
Additional methodologies may be employed to enhance the analysis and model development as needed.
